[2025-10-17T18:14:03.698Z] USER: why is the second one more expensive
[2025-10-17T18:14:07.614Z] ASSISTANT: The second flight option is more expensive primarily because it includes an additional flight segment from Madrid (MAD) to Buenos Aires (EZE). This extra leg of the journey can involve different airlines, routes,
                           or demand factors that can affect pricing. Additionally, the longer duration and multiple connections might result in higher operational costs for the airline, which are then reflected in the ticket price. The first option
                           is a direct flight from Zurich to Buenos Aires, which is typically less expensive due to fewer connections and lower operational complexity.
